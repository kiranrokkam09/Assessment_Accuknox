# **Django Trainee Assessment - Accuknox**

## **Overview**

This repository contains solutions to the Django Trainee Assessment provided by Accuknox. The assessment includes questions on Django Signals and Custom Classes in Python.

---

## **Repository Structure**

Each question's answer is stored in a separate file within this repository:

### **Django Signals**

- `Signals-Django/Question-1.md` - Demonstrates whether Django signals execute synchronously or asynchronously.
- `Signals-Django/Question-2.md` - Checks if Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
- `Signals-Django/Question-3.md` - Determines if Django signals execute within the same database transaction as the caller.

### **Custom Classes in Python**

- `CustomClasses-Django/Rectangle_Class.py` - Implements a `Rectangle` class with iterable behavior.

## **Assessment Questions**

### **Topic: Django Signals**

#### **Question 1:**

By default, are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

#### **Question 2:**

Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

#### **Question 3:**

By default, do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

### **Topic: Custom Classes in Python**

#### **Description:**

You are tasked with creating a `Rectangle` class with the following requirements:

- An instance of the `Rectangle` class requires `length: int` and `width: int` to be initialized.
- We can iterate over an instance of the `Rectangle` class.
- When an instance of the `Rectangle` class is iterated over, we first get its length in the format: `{'length': <VALUE_OF_LENGTH>}` followed by the width `{width: <VALUE_OF_WIDTH>}`.
