# **Question:**

Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

---

## **Answer:**

Yes, by default, Django signals run in the **same thread** as the caller. This means that the signal handler executes within the same execution flow as the function that triggered it.

To prove this, we will:

- Print the current thread ID in both the main execution and the signal handler.
- Compare the thread IDs to check if they match.

# **Code:**

```python
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.apps import AppConfig

# Signal Handler
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def check_thread_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal Handler Thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")  # Print thread ID

# App Configuration to Connect Signal
class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
    name = "myapp"

    def ready(self):
        import myapp.signals  # Ensures signals are registered

# Test Signal Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    import time

    print(f"Main Execution Thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")  # Print main thread ID
    user = User.objects.create(username="test_user")  # Triggers signal
```

---

# **Output:**

```
Main Execution Thread ID: 140735899693888
Signal Handler Thread ID: 140735899693888
```

---

## **Conclusion:**

Since both the **main execution thread** and the **signal handler thread** have the same thread ID, it confirms that Django signals execute **in the same thread as the caller** by default.
