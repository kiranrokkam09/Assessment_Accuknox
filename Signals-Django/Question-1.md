# **Question:**

By default, are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

## **Answer:**

By default, Django signals are executed **synchronously**. This means that when a signal is triggered, the connected receiver function runs **immediately** in the same thread before the execution continues. If the signal handler contains a long-running operation, it will **block** the execution until the handler completes.

To demonstrate this behavior, we will create a `post_save` signal that introduces an artificial delay using `time.sleep()`. Then, we will measure the total execution time to confirm whether the signal executes synchronously.

# **Code:**

```python
import time
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.apps import AppConfig

# Signal Handler
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def slow_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received. Simulating a delay...")
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Signal execution completed.")

# App Configuration to Connect Signal
class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"
    name = "myapp"

    def ready(self):
        import myapp.signals

# Test Signal Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    start_time = time.time()
    user = User.objects.create(username="test_user")
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

---

# **Output:**

```
Signal received. Simulating a delay...
(Sleeps for 5 seconds)
Signal execution completed.
Total execution time: 5.xx seconds
```

---

## **Conclusion:**

Since the total execution time includes the delay introduced by the signal handler (`time.sleep(5)`), this confirms that Django signals execute **synchronously by default**.
